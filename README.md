### An Elderly Care and Safety App

The Age Guardian comprises two core applications within its suite: the User App and the Guardian App. These applications work in tandem to provide a holistic and technologically advanced solution for the well-being and safety of elderly individuals.

1. The User App serves as the primary interface for elderly individuals, offering a suite of essential functionalities
2. The Guardian App is designed to empower caregivers and guardians with real-time information about the elderly user's well-being

The "Age Guardian" project is a testament to the successful integration of advanced sensor technologies, cloud-based services, and data analytics. 
By leveraging camera data for heart rate monitoring, accelerometer data for respiratory rate calculation, and gyrometer sensors for fall detection, achieved precise and real-time health monitoring. 
The incorporation of a fuzzy logic algorithm for risk assessment, based on weather and health data, enhances user decision-making.
The utilization of AWS SQS for asynchronous communication and Amazon DynamoDB for data storage showcases the scalability and reliability of cloud services in a real-world application.
